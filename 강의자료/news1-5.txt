Nato leaders are meeting near London, as tensions between members threaten to overshadow a summit marking the military alliance's 70th birthday.

The three-hour talks are expected to cover issues such as cyber-attacks and the strategic challenge posed by China.

In opening remarks, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson reminded members of the alliance's principle of "one for all, and all for one".
